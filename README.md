## Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Introduction
This repository serves as the foundational step in analyzing and documenting the requirements for a software development project. It is part of the FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint course and focuses on simulating real-world requirement analysis for a booking management system.

The goal is to enhance understanding of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by mastering the principles of requirement elicitation, documentation, validation, and visualization. Through a structured and practical approach, this project emphasizes the importance of clarity and precision in capturing both functional and non-functional requirements, setting the stage for successful project execution.
